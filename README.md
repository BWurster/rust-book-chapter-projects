# rust-book-chapter-projects
This repo is for me to learn rust!

As I work through rustlings and read the rust book, at each chapter, I will perfrom a small project that untilizes the concepts from the current chapter. I will also include a `README.md` file in each folder to talk about the specific concept covered and act as book notes of sorts.
